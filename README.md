# AirBnB Project
AirBnB is an online platform where tourists can get affordable homes for vacation purposes. The AirBnB project is aimed at building a clone of the AirBnB platform, to teach the fundamentals of software engineering and web application development.

## AirBnB Project - The console

The console is a command interpreter (a sort of mini shell) for managing the objects of our project.
It will be capable of doing the following functions:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

###  How to start it:
In order to start the console, you must use the following command:
```./console.py```

### How To Use:

- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interprete
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
- Commands: create, show, destroy, all (shows all), update, help, quit

### Example how to open:

From the command line, enter the following code to open the command interpreter (console)
```
$ ./console.py
```
Once the console is opened, you will see the following info on the screen.
You can type "help" or "?" to see documented commands, or "help" followed by the specific command, to know what the command does.

```
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) help
(hbnb) help quit
